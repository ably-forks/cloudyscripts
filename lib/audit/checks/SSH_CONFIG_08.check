Name: SSH host-based authentication for version 2
Description: >
   Check that host based authentication is not allowed for protocol version 2.
   There must not be a  "HostbasedAuthentication yes" line in your SSHD configuration.
WarningMessage: >
   Hostbased authentication is a bad idea, as you need to trust the computer from which you login as
   much as the one you log into. Use user-based authentication instead.
